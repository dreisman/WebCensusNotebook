# WebCensusNotebook

A Python3 jupyter notebook for interacting with Princeton WebTAP's Web Census.

To get started, open `demo.ipynb`. There you will find how to use our libraries to access our web census data.

Any methods called in `demo.ipynb` that save their output will write their output to the `results/` directory.
